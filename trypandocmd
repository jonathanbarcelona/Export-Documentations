INDEX CAPTURE FIELDS AND RULES

1. Vendor ID

#+begin_quote
Rules:
#+end_quote

1. Selected and returned from vendor file lookup where there is a UNIQUE
   match on the vendor name and address fields (Street, City, State,
   ZIP, Country). It is normal that vendor name will have multiple
   records in the vendor file lookup. Select the vendor ID of the record
   whose address matches the address indicated on the invoice.

2. Capture Area Hierarchy:

   1. Invoice Remit To address (or Make Payable To; or Send Payment To)

   2. Invoice Letterhead address

   3. Invoice Logo address

3. If there is more than 1 match - leave Vendor ID field blank. Index
   Vendor Name field.

4. If there is no match - leave Vendor ID field blank. Index Vendor Name
   field.

5. If vendor name does NOT match but address matches - leave Vendor ID
   field blank. Index Vendor Name field.

6. If there is a unique vendor name match, but there is no vendor
   address indicated on the invoice - leave Vendor ID field blank. Index
   Vendor Name field.

7. If there is a unique vendor name match but the street address is
   empty in the data file - leave Vendor ID field blank. Index Vendor
   Name field.

8. If the only difference with the addresses in the database is the
   4-digit ZIP code extension, then consider this as a match.
   Example:“40218” is the zip code on the image; “40218-4506” is the zip
   code in the vendor file.

9. Address abbreviations are considered matches (St vs Street, Blvd vs
   Boulevard). If the difference is due to an abbreviation, then
   consider this as a match. Example: "Street" on the image; "St" in the
   vendor file.

10. For companies using a trade name, (i.e., DBA, AKA, etc.), the trade
    name will sometimes be found in the street name address field of the
    vendor file. Consider this as a match.

#+begin_quote
Example: On the invoice, the address is "PO Box 1774, New York, NY
10156-1774". On the vendor file the address is "DBA: EQUINOX FITNESS
CLUBS; PO BOX 1774, New York, NY 10156-1774".
#+end_quote

11. [@11] Validation Check: If Vendor ID field is populated, then Vendor
    Name field should be blank (and vice-versa).

2. [@2] Vendor Name

   1. Only index Vendor Name if a unique match for Vendor ID is NOT
      available.

   2. Capture Area Hierarchy:

      1. Invoice Remit To address (or Make Payable To; or Send Payment
         To)

      2. Invoice Letterhead address

      3. Invoice Logo address

   3. Validation Check: If Vendor ID field is populated, then Vendor
      Name field should be blank (and vice-versa).

3. Invoice Date

   1. Format as, “YYYYMMDD”.

   2. Rule: The first M will have 0 (zero) stored as the value if a
      single digit month is entered. Rule 2: The first D will have 0
      (zero) stored as the value if a single digit day is entered.

   3. Leave blank if not available or not clear.

   4. Capture future Invoice Date as shown.

   5. For utility invoices where invoice date is missing, the ‘Period
      To' date will be captured instead.

   6. If there is no invoice date, then use CTI's date of indexing.

   7. Key valid dates only, partial invoice dates are not keyed. If
      invalid/partial, then use CTI's date of indexing.

   8. *Rules for Normalizing Canadian/European Dates to US dates*

      1. European date format (dd/mm/yyyy or yyyy/mm/dd) needs to be
         normalized to US format (mm/dd/yyyy) when the data is labeled
         dd/mm/yyyy or yyyy/mm/dd or dd/mm/yy or yy/mm/dd or its
         spelled-out equivalent.

      2. For European date formats that are unlabeled, and where the
         month will be invalid (not 1-12) then the format is assumed to
         be dd/mm/yyyy. Flip the date and month to normalize to US
         format.

      3. For European date formats that are unlabeled, but the year is
         obviously listed first (yyyy/mm/dd or yy/mm/dd), then the date
         is changed to have the year output last and the 2nd piece of
         data output as the month, 3rd piece of data as the date. Should
         the month be invalid, flip the date and month to normalize to
         US format.

      4. After normalization to US date format during the key entry
         process, the date will be programmatically formatted and
         written to the XML index file as yyyymmdd (this is the format
         we use on all corcentric clients).

4. Invoice Number

   1. Capture as shown.

   2. Invoice numbers listed as line items in a Statement of Account
      will not be captured.

   3. If invoice number is missing or illegible on the invoice but there
      is an account number, use the account number concatenated/appended
      with the invoice date in the MMDDYY format as the invoice number.
      When indexing the account number enter alpha numeric entries only.
      Do not enter special characters or spaces.

   4. The Account Number may labeled as Customer Number.

   5. If no invoice date is available to append to the Account Number,
      use the date the document is indexed.

   6. If there is no invoice number or account number, leave invoice
      number blank.

5. PO Number

   1. Leave blank if illegible or not found.

   2. PO Number format is usually AMnnnnn

   3. Do not index “NA”, “N/A” and “Not Applicable”.

   4. *UPDATE 03/18/2016* - In regard to the PO number field, please
      look at both the Order Number and PO Number field - if the number
      is AM and is followed by 5 digits, this needs to be indexed as the
      PO number.

6. Point of Contact

   1. Leave blank if illegible or not found.

   2. Capture name prefixes if shown (MS, MR, MRS, DR, etc.)

   3. Some POCs may be departments like ACCOUNTS PAYABLE or branch
      numbers such as C/O BRANCH # 239.

   4. Typically found within the header of the invoice (BILL-TO address
      block) referenced by words like attention to, contact or just a
      person's name by itself within address section where the invoice
      is sent to.

   5. Acceptable Variations

      1. Attn

      2. Attn.

      3. Attn to

      4. Attention To

      5. Contact

      6. Contact Person

   6.

7. Invoice Total Amount

   1. Leave blank if illegible.

   2. If amount is crossed out, leave blank.

   3. For credit amounts, capture with a negative (-) sign.

   4. Debit Notes -- Positive Amount

   5. Return Invoice -- Negative Amount

   6. On utility bills/progressive invoices, it is common to have
      current and past due charges where the total due is the sum of the
      current and past charges. Being the past charges are on another
      invoices, the rule is that if an invoice has current and past due
      charges that we always capture the current charges and not the
      total of the current and past due charges. Although this is mostly
      on utility invoices this rule is for all invoices with current and
      past due charges.

   7. If an invoice has current and past due charges capture the current
      charges and not the total of the current and past due charges.
      Exception: if credits are applied and the amount due reflects
      current charges with credits applied use the amount due. Integer
      format with 2 decimals. No commas or $ signs used. Example:
      10234000.86. Exception: Blank if not available.

   suppliers.

2. Question: Are there certain formats (prefixes) for the PO numbers
   that we should look out for?

Answer: No, you should not be keeping an eye out for anything beyond
your given scope to date. This piece is with the client.

VENDOR ID SELECTION (02/17/2015)

1. If there are multiple matches on the vendor file for the vendor
   name/address combination, then take note of the alpha character
   suffix on the UNIQUE_VENDOR_NUMBER column of the vendor file.

2. Match the SOLD TO/BILL TO entity on the invoice that corresponds to
   the last 3 alpha characters.

3. In this example, since the SOLD TO/BILL TO entity is GEM CHEM INC.,
   this will correspond to *--GEM*, so we should select the first record
   whose vendor number is 00050306-GEM.
